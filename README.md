# OpenAI_PDF_reader
The code provides a way to access PDF(s), get all the text from PDF and then use that to feed the OpenAI API, which can be utilised to answer things related to the PDF. Further, it cleans the text by following the classic sentiment analysis way to clean it.

Before running the code on Google Colab (what I did), one must do these things.

- [ ] On their google drive, create a folder named ‘Test_files’ and then inside this folder create another folder named ‘Example_Documents’. (Names are case-sensitive)

- [ ] Put all the data (The PDFs) in the ‘Example_Documents’ folder.

- [ ] When the code asks “Enter the path to the PDF file:” Just put the name of the pdf file you want to use, that is saved in ‘Example_Documents’ folder.
